# Minimum-Spanning-Tree
C++ program that implements prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph.
Reads an input.txt file that contains an adjacency matrix representation of a graph.
Displays output in an output.txt file contains the adjacency matrix of the minumum spanning tree of the given graph.
